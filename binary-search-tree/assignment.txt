BST Lab- due 12/17 via email
Write a C++ program to validate computer user-ids and passwords.  A list of valid ids and passwords (unsorted) is read from a file and stored in a Binary Search Tree (BST) of UserInfo objects.  When  user-ids and passwords are entered during execution, this BST is searched to determine whether they are legal.

   Input (file): UserInfo records for valid users
   Input (keyboard): Ids and passwords of users logging in
   Output (screen):  Messages indicating whether user-ids and passwords are valid, as well as an alphabetical listing of all valid ids and passwords at the end of the run.


Note: you will need to overload >>, <<, ==, and < operators in the UserInfo class in order to accomplish this task.

BST.h class is on Blackboard.
